 * Data persistence implemented in previous commit
 To create, run 
	imageapp/create_database.py
 To create the testing DB, run 
	imageapp/test_database/create_test_database.py
 * Setup a static IP for site - http://imageapp.xavdev.com
 Please let me know if the page hangs / doesn't load and
 I can restart the server. The free Amazon EC2 service isn't 
 the most reliable.
 * Added a set of test data and a README about the data. You
 can find this in imageapp/test_database.
